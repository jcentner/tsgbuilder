Background: 

What are tools in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service?
To empower your AI agent with grounded data or the capability to take actions and automating workflows, the Foundry Agent service provides a wide range of built-in tools, such as Grounding with Bing Search, Azure AI Search, Azure Logic Apps, as well as third-party partner tools, such as Tripadvisor. This page is designed to provide an overview of tools provided in the Foundry Agent Service.
Knowledge tools
To keep your AI agent informed with richer context from various data sources. The Foundry Agent Service has covered a wide range of data types:
	• private data: Azure AI Search, File Search, Microsoft Fabric, and more
	• public web data: Grounding with Bing Search
	• licensed data: Tripadvisor, Morningstar
	• unstructured data: Azure AI Search, File Search
	• structured data: Microsoft Fabric and more


Limitation:

Currently, you can add multiple tools but you can add one instance of each of the following tools: File Search, Azure AI Search, Grounding with Bing Search, Grounding with Bing Custom Search, Microsoft Fabric, and other tools under knowledge section.

Adding more than one of these tools to an agent results in the headline error. Customers should stick to one tool per agent, and they can work around this by using connected agents (e.g. a primary orchestrator agent connected to three other agents, each with a separate Azure AI Search tool pointing at different indices).
