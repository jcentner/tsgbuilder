### Vision: The same day that a solution for a new issue is posted in an AVA thread or ICM, we have a TSG draft PR up in the relevant wiki and ready for review.

#### Post-draft

Extend TSG Builder with the ability to create pull requests for new TSGs on wikis

#### Pre-draft

Build a service that reviews AVA channels on a regular basis for new TSG subjects (which could then trigger the tsgbuilder) 
 
- scan AVA for all recent posts
- if solution is offered, see if information seems "new" (compare against info already in TSGs in wikis)
- if info doesn't exist, kick off tsgbuilder based on AVA content and create PR for new TSG for review
 
We can kick off an agent that compares the solution thread against existing TSGs in a research fashion. Then, if it passes criteria, we've identified a new TSG could be added and the AVA thread is a logical place to get the input notes to kick off tsgbuilder.
