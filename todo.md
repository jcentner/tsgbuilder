- major cleanup before merge

- test executable on different platforms

- see if we need a stop server/close button in the UI. 

- Change follow up questions so the user can also address review notes with feedback. Also "submit answers" and "skip" should be blocked out when a revision is being generated, just like clear session is when any generation is in process.  

- with exe, what happens with "Save TSG with current content"? User is not informed

- UI gives "failed to fetch" if server is killed and user tries anything
