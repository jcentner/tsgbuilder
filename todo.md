- make sure writer and reviewer prompts both know the point/purpose/bigger picture
- check that bing connection timeouts are surfaced properly (not just a generic "read failed" error) 
- check that other service issues are surfaced with good user-facing error messages so service vs app issues are distinct
- major cleanup before merge
