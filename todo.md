- major error handling improvements: see plan doc
- major cleanup before merge

- test executable on different platforms
- test build process through github actions, tag, and releases
git tag v1.0.0-beta.1
git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1
check GitHub Releases draft 


- see if we need a stop server/close button in the UI; how does exe run on windows? 

- does "Review Notes" need revisions? auto-apply button? checkbox around what ones the user wants to apply and then a button to apply the changes?
