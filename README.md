# TSG Builder – Troubleshooting Guide Generator

Turn raw troubleshooting notes into polished **Technical Support Guides (TSGs)** in minutes. TSG Builder uses a multi-agent pipeline to research, write, and review your TSGs automatically.

## Why TSG Builder?

Writing high-quality troubleshooting guides is essential to Support knowledge curation, but tedious. In fast-moving areas like Azure AI Support, new issues emerge constantly, each requiring a new TSG for ease-of-reference by Support Engineers and AI-based support tools.

TSG Builder was born out of this need. The idea: **you provide a raw dump of info to start from, the tool researches and formats**.

- **Human + AI collaboration** — You curate initial notes from cases, threads with engineering, incidents; the agent enhances them with research from public docs like Microsoft Learn and relevant GitHub discussions
- **Fits existing workflows** — Support and supportability teams already review common issues to identify TSG candidates; those notes become your input
- **Broadly applicable** — Agnostic to team, technology, or support area

## Prerequisites

### Azure Resources Required

| Resource | Purpose | How to Get |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Azure AI Foundry Project** | Hosts the agent | [Create a project](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/create-projects) |
| **Model Deployment** | LLM for the agent (recommended: `gpt-5.2`) | Deploy in your project |

### Local Requirements

- **Azure CLI** — Logged in with `az login` ([Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli))
- **For source builds only**: Python 3.9+, GNU Make

## Using TSG Builder

> ⏱️ **Timing**: A full run (Research → Write → Review) typically takes **2–5 minutes** depending on the complexity of your input and the amount of research needed.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This tool uses a Foundry Agent to search the internet. A built-in **PII check** scans your input before generation and blocks any content containing emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, credentials, or other customer-identifiable information. You'll be prompted to edit or redact before proceeding.

**Features:**
- ⚙️ **Built-in setup wizard** — Configure, validate, and create agents from the browser
- 📝 Paste notes directly in the browser
- 🖼️ **Image support** — Attach screenshots via drag-and-drop, file picker, or paste
- 🔄 Interactive follow-up questions
- 📋 One-click copy to clipboard
- 👁️ **Raw/Preview toggle** — Switch between raw markdown and rendered preview
- 📊 Real-time status indicators
- 💡 Load example input with one click

### Attaching Images

You can include screenshots or images with your troubleshooting notes:

1. **Drag and drop** — Drag image files onto the upload zone
2. **Click to upload** — Click the upload zone to open file picker

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP. Maximum 10 images per request.

Images are sent to the AI agent for visual analysis, which is especially useful for:
- Error screenshots
- Architecture diagrams
- Console/terminal output
- Configuration screenshots

## Configuration

The setup wizard (opens automatically on first run) guides you through configuration:

1. Click the **⚙️ Setup** button (or it opens automatically)
2. Enter your Azure configuration values
3. Click **Save Configuration**
4. Run **Validation** to verify everything works
5. Click **Create Agents**

### Finding Your Configuration Values

#### PROJECT_ENDPOINT
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your AI Foundry resource
3. Select your project
4. Copy the endpoint from the Overview page

#### MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
1. In AI Foundry Portal, go to Deployments
2. Use the name of your deployed model (e.g., `gpt-5.2`)

## How It Works

TSG Builder uses a **three-stage pipeline**: Research → Write → Review.

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  RESEARCH   │───▶│    WRITE    │───▶│   REVIEW    │───▶│   OUTPUT    │
│  🔍         │    │   ✏️         │    │   🔎        │    │   ✅        │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
  Uses tools        No tools           Validates          Final TSG
  (Web, MCP)         Just writes        & fact-checks
```

1. **Research** — Searches Microsoft Learn and the web for documentation, GitHub issues, and community solutions
2. **Write** — Generates the TSG using only your notes + research (no tool access = no hallucinated searches)
3. **Review** — Validates structure and fact-checks against research; auto-fixes or retries if needed

If information is missing, the agent inserts `{{MISSING::...}}` placeholders and asks follow-up questions.

Output follows the [DFM-copilot-optimized TSG template](https://dev.azure.com/Supportability/AzureCognitiveServices/_git/AzureML?path=/AzureML/Welcome/TSG-Template.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview). For detailed architecture information, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Troubleshooting

### "PROJECT_ENDPOINT is required"
- Ensure `.env` file exists and contains `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
- The executable creates `.env` automatically on first run

### "Azure authentication failed"
- Ensure Azure CLI is installed ([Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli))
- Run `az login` to authenticate
- Ensure your account has access to the AI Foundry project

### "Failed to connect to project"
- Verify `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is correct
- Check you have the "Azure AI User" role on the project

### "Agent not found"
- Open the web UI and use the Setup wizard to create the agents
- Check `.agent_ids.json` file exists in the same directory as the executable

### Agent doesn't use tools / research
- The agent instructions mandate research before output
- If this persists, recreate the agent via the Setup wizard

### TSG missing documentation links
- The agent is instructed to include URLs from research in "Related Information"
- Check the agent is correctly configured with both Bing and Learn MCP tools

### "PII check failed: authentication error"
- The PII check uses the AI Services endpoint from your Foundry resource (derived from `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`)
- Run `az login` to refresh your credentials
- Ensure your account has access to your Foundry project

### PII check flags a false positive
- The `Person` category may occasionally flag Azure service names or technical terms
- Click **"Go Back & Edit"** to adjust your notes, or **"Redact & Continue"** to accept the automatic redaction
- If a category consistently produces false positives, maintainers can adjust `PII_CATEGORIES` in `pii_check.py`

## Telemetry

TSG Builder collects **anonymous usage telemetry** to help improve the tool. Telemetry is enabled by default in release binaries and can be fully disabled.

### What Is Collected

- **Counts and enums** — event names (e.g. "TSG generated", "setup completed"), stage names, error classifications
- **Durations** — pipeline and per-stage wall-clock times
- **Token counts** — per-stage input/output token usage (aggregate numbers, never content)
- **Version and platform** — app version, OS platform, Python version, run mode (source/executable)
- **Install ID** — a random UUID generated on first run, stored in `.env` as `TSG_INSTALL_ID`. Not derived from any machine, user, or network identifier

### What Is Never Collected

- Notes, TSG content, or any user-authored text
- Error messages containing user content
- PII of any kind
- File paths, Azure resource names, endpoints, or credentials
- IP addresses or network identifiers

### How to Opt Out

Set `TSG_TELEMETRY=0` in your `.env` file (same directory as the executable or project root):

```
TSG_TELEMETRY=0
```

Or set the environment variable before running:

```bash
TSG_TELEMETRY=0 ./tsg-builder-linux
```

When opted out:
- No events are emitted
- No `install_id` is generated or persisted
- The app behaves identically otherwise

2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run `make lint` to check syntax
5. Run `make test` to verify tests pass
6. Submit a pull request

### Creating a Release

Releases are built automatically by GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed:

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.0          # or v1.0.0-beta.1 for pre-release
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This triggers a workflow that:
1. Builds executables for Linux, macOS, and Windows
2. Generates SHA256 checksums
3. Creates a **draft release** with all files attached

After the workflow completes, go to the [Releases page](../../releases) to review and publish.

### Maintainer Notes: PII Detection

<details>
<summary>Click to expand PII detection details (project maintainers only)</summary>

TSG Builder includes a pre-flight PII check powered by the **Azure AI Language PII API** via the AI Services endpoint built into each user's Foundry resource. End users need no additional setup — the PII endpoint is derived from the `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` they already configure.

#### How It Works

- **Endpoint derivation**: `pii_check.py` extracts the AI Services base URL from `PROJECT_ENDPOINT` (strips `/api/projects/<project>`) and uses it with `TextAnalyticsClient`
- **Auth**: `DefaultAzureCredential` (same Entra ID used for Foundry)
- **RBAC**: Users who can access their Foundry project already have the necessary permissions for AI Services PII detection
- **Fail-closed**: If the PII API is unreachable or errors, generation is blocked

#### Complementary: Foundry Model PII Content Filter

As an additional (optional) layer, a PII content filter can be configured on the Foundry model deployment via the Azure AI Foundry portal. This filters PII from model *outputs* and is complementary to the input-side PII check in `pii_check.py`. This is a manual portal configuration, not a code change.
